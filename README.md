What's so special about JS Compiler:
1. You can create multiple code and text cells.
2. The code is cumulative (i.e multiple cells are connected to each other).
3. Change the cell's direction.
4. Has built-in React support.

Note: If you only have one code cell you cannot delete it or other text cells
